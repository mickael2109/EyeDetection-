Project EyeDetection is an application that uses OpenCV to detect faces and eyes from a real-time video stream, such as a webcam. This project implements image processing and machine learning techniques to locate faces and draw circles on detected eyes. It uses cascading classifiers, such as Haar files for face and eye detection.

Key features:
Real-time video capture via webcam.
Face detection using the Haar classifier.
Detection of eyes in identified faces.
Display of red circles on detected eyes to mark their position.
Use of OpenCV for image processing and real-time detection.
